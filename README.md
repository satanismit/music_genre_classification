# Music Genre Classification

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to classify music into different genres using machine learning techniques. By analyzing audio features, the model predicts the genre of a given track, providing insights into music categorization.

## 🔥 Features
- Preprocessing of audio files to extract meaningful features
- Training machine learning models for classification
- Evaluation of model performance using various metrics
- Visualization of results for better interpretability

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Librosa (for audio processing)
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow/Keras (for deep learning models)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset consists of audio files labeled with their respective genres. It includes features such as:
- Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs)
- Spectral Centroid
- Zero-Crossing Rate
- Chroma Features
